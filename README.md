# 💼 mi_react_portfolio

This is a personal React-based portfolio I built to get hands-on experience with React and modern front-end development. It serves as both a creative playground and a portfolio to showcase my bio, projects, and certifications.

> **My POV:**  
> I made this to feel how React is — how components, props, and state come together to build something modular and interactive. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of React while also giving me a space to apply CSS and animation techniques in a real-world layout.
